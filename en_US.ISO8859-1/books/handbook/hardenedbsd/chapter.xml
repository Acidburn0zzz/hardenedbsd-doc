		<para>HardenedBSD is a fork of FreeBSD, founded
		    in 2014, that implements exploit mitigations and
		    security hardening technologies. The primary goal
		    of HardenedBSD is to port over the grsecurity
		    patchset for Linux to HardenedBSD.

		<title>History</title>
		<para>Work on HardenedBSD began in 2013 when Oliver
		    Pinter and Shawn Webb started working on an
		    implementation of Address Space Layout
		    Randomization (ASLR) for FreeBSD. At that time,
		    HardenedBSD was meant to be a staging area for
		    experimental development on the ASLR patch. Over
		    time, as the process of upstreaming ASLR to
		    FreeBSD became more difficult, HardenedBSD
		    naturally became a fork.
		</para>
		<para>HardenedBSD completed its ASLR implementation
		    in 2015 with the strongest form of ASLR ever
		    implemented in any of the BSDs. Since then,
		    HardenedBSD has moved on to implementing other
		    exploit mitigations and hardening technologies.
		    OPNsense, an open source firewall based on
		    FreeBSD, incorporated HardenedBSD's ASLR
		    implementation in 2016.
		</para>
		<para>HardenedBSD exists today as a fork of FreeBSD
		    that closely follows FreeBSD's source code.
		    HardenedBSD syncs with FreeBSD every six hours
		    for the following FreeBSD branches:
